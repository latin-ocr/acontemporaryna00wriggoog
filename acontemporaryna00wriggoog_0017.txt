The privacy with which the meetings of proscribed sectarim were
necessarily conducted, rendered it easy for ealumny to transfer to them the
abominabis scenes which were supposed to take place at the witches’
’ sabbath, and nothing was calculated to render their cause more unpopular·
for witchcrast and sorcery were more fearful in the eyes of the vulgar
· than heresy itself. The charge has been frequently repeated ιιι different ·
ages and under different circumstances. Not to speak of the Gnostics and
other secta of antiquity, the orgies of the witches were without doubt the
types of the worst accusations brought against the Templarsg and similar
charges at a much later period were made against the the Huguenots in
France and against the Puritans' m England. The earliest instance of the
direct combination of the charges of heresy and sorcery is presented by the
sect of the waldenses, οι· Vaudois. A singular account of the origin of
this sect is given in an early anonymous tract on the history of the
Carthasian order, where it is stated that a Vaudois, who lived at Lyon,
following the letter of the New Testament, quitted all his riche· ιο embrace
voluntat-y poverty‚ and caused some of the books of the Bible ιο be trans·
lated into the vulgar tongue. The followers of this man, when they found
themselves overcome and refuted by the power of the Catholics, as a last
resource entered into league with the devil, and became sorcerers, and from
that time they were''commonly nich-named Scobacss, or riders upon a
,coba or besem. Many of thern were seised and burnt. The writer ue
this tract gives the story of one of these heretica named william Edeline,
who had been first a carmelite, next a carthusien, and lsstly a Benedictine
monk- He finally joined the waldenses, and entered into a league with
the devii, who for that purpose appeared ιο him in human form. From
