crimes cognizable in the secular, and not in the ecclesiastical, coarta- ‘We “
find en instance so 'early ns the reign of king John, where the person
sccused was tried by the ordeal of hot iton, and acquitted! The trial of
witches by the ordeal was the origin of the more recent popular trial hy
dipping in the water, a custom which in Franee was forbidden by s decision
of the parliament at the beginning of the seventeenth century. The prosed
cutiens for witchcraft did not take the dark character which they afterwards
assumed, till they had been adopted ns a. part of the charges against heretica
and in the papacy of John XXII„ during the reign of our Edwerd ῙῙ., they
became still more serious by being used ns means of personal or politicnl
vengeance. French history presents us with several examples st the period
of which we are speaking. In one year, 1324, two remarkable prosecutione
for witchcraft occur in Ireland and in England z the former was the case of
dame Alice Kyteler (narrated in the present volume), the other was n
pretended attempt to bewitch the king, the two Despenserffi and others, in ·
order to bring about their death. ' An account of this latter csse will ‚be
found st the end of this Prefacez the offenders were tried in e common law
court, and ⁸were ecquitted. lt was only in Irelsnd that the witches were
prosecuted by the Church as heretics. We lem-n from the Yenr Book thet
s man was arrested on suspicion of sorcery in the 45th year of Edward 111„
and brought before the justice of the King’s Bench, by whom he was
'acquitted for want of evidence,† which shows that it was still looked upon
merely es sn offence against common law.

During the fourteenth century the question of witaehcrsft seems to have “
been much agitated, and the Church appears to have been actively employed ·
in seeking it out. There is along chapter on the subJect in the Wicliffite
treatise published by the Camden society, and it is eernestly forbidden
