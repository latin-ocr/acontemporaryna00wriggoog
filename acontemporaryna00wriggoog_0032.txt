Engushmenss And 1:212· 2120 we omium, hove nm ‘the ‚eid patented
nuringe hetwixt the above-named king Edward and Elizabeth Grey wan
made of grete presumption, without the knowyng and assent of the lords
of this lond, and aleo hy sorcerie and wichecrafte, committed by the said
Elizaheth and her moder Jaquett duchesne of Bcdford, aa the common
opinion of the people, and the publique voice and fame is thorough all this
land3 and hereafter, if and as the caus shall require, shall hee proved
sufficiently in tyme and place convenient. And here also we consider,
howe that the said pretensed marriage was made privatly and secrete-ly,
without edition of hanna, in a private chamber, a prophane place, and not
openly in the face of the church, aftre the lewe of Godde's chnrche, hut
contrarie thereunto, and the laudable custome of the church of Englonde.
And howe, also, that at the tyme of conti-act of the same pretensed marriage,
and hifore and longe tfme aster, the naid king Edward was and etode
maryed and trouth-pliglxt ιο oone dame Elianor Butteler, doughter of the
old earl of Shreweshmy', with whome the same kyng Edwnrd had made a
precontrncte of matdmonie, longe tyme bifore he made the said pretensed
niaringe with the said Elisabeth Grey, in manner and fourme abovesaid.
Which preminet being true, as in verny uouth they been true, it appeti-eth
and followeth evidently that the said king Edward dnryng his lif, and the
zeid Elisabeth, lived together sinfully and dampnnbly in adultery, against
the lawe of God and off his chureheg and therefore noo marvnile that, the
souverain lord and the head of this land being of such ungodly disposicion,
and provokyng the ire and indignacion of oure Lord God, such haynouu
mischieffs and inconveniente, aa is above remembred⁹ were 'used and comitted

in the reame amongs the subgeets. Alae it appetu-eth evidently and followeth .

thnt all thissue and chssdren of the eeid kiug Edward been bum-dn, and
unable ιο inherite or ιο chyme any thing hy inheritance, by the lawe and
custome of Englond.'' ’
