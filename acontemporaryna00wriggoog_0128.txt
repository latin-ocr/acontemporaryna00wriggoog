application to the purposes of literature of the invalueble collection of
MSS. formed by Sir Robert Cotton 3 and is, in truth, a collection of
interesting memorials of the literature of the last three centuries. So
long aa the support of the Members‚ and the zeal of the Editor-s, enable
the Couneil to §end forth such workn, they see no reason to doubt that
the Society will continue its useful and honourable oourse. Stores of
invaluable MSS. yet remain unpublished, many of them in private
hands, · and Membern of the Society cannot do better service ιο
literature than by calling the attention of the Council to any MSS. of the
latter class which may hoppen to be necessible to them. Nothing would
be more adv untageous to the Society than that the examples of Lord
Francis Egerton and the Duke of Rutland should have many imitatore.
