10 aaroni· or ‘rus summas.

And we further state that during the past year the reeeipts on account
of subscription: in arrear have exceeded those on the same account during
the year preceding by the sum os 3101 3 but the Treasurer and Secretary
have reported to us, that the change in the mode of receiving Subscrip-
tions through Post Office orders, instead of by Local Secretaries, has not
hitherto worked so well as was anticipated. Although it has stopped arrears
in some places where they did exist, it has created them in others where
before they did not, and many valuable Members whose Subscriptions
were formerly received, have now fallen into arrear, notwithstanding strong
endeavours made to prevent it. We beg ιο represent to the Members the
great importance of an early and regular payment of their subscriptione, and
we would recommend to such of them whose convenience it maysuit, to
adopt the system of perpetual cheques θ upon their bankers, or any other
mode which will secure the payment of the small Annual subscription
from being omitted or forgotoen.

It having also been reported to us that the Foreign Subscriptions
occasion considerable inconvenience‚ and get into long arrear, we would
recommend that it should be considered whether it would not be advisable
to direct all Foreign Members‚ or at any event those, hereafter to be
admitted, to name some person in London, by whom their subscriptione
will be paid, and to whom their books are ιο be delivered.

The Treasurer has also suggested to us that it would be advantageous
to the society, that he should be authorized to invest sums paid to him
for Compositions, from time ιο time, when they amount to a sufficient
sum ιο purchase 225 stock, the adoption of which suggestion we beg to
recommend. ’ ’ Witness our hands this esth day of April, 1843.
